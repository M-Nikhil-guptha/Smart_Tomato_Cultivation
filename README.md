# <p align="center">IoT enhanced tomato plant cultivation with machine learning</p>


## ABSTRACT

The project introduces an IoT and Machine Learning (ML) enhanced system designed to  enhance tomato cultivation, addressing the challenges of modern agriculture by optimizing resource usage while meeting the rising global food demand. The system's core components include soil moisture and nutrient sensors, continuously monitoring and maintaining optimal soil conditions. Soil moisture sensors triggers irrigation when the soil becomes dry, ensuring proper hydration, while nutrient sensors regulate Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels for robust plant growth. Innovatively, the project integrates ML through a camera module capturing real-time plant images. A sophisticated ML model identifies potential pest threats like insects and diseases, autonomously activating a pesticide spray system for immediate mitigation. Remote monitoring via an IoT interface empowers users to access real-time data and configure settings. This IoT and ML-driven tomato cultivation system offers resource-efficient, proactivezn, and  sustainable agriculture, elevating crop yields and reducing environmental impact.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

In conventional tomato cultivation, inefficient irrigation, imprecise nutrient management, pest-related crop losses, and resource-intensive practices hinder the pursuit of sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the absence of data-driven insights limits informed decision-making in the context of tomato farming.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

Our project aims to address these challenges by developing an integrated system that leverages IoT and Machine Learning to optimize irrigation, enhance nutrient management, enable real-time pest detection and control, promote sustainable farming practices, and provide data-driven decision support for tomato cultivation.
